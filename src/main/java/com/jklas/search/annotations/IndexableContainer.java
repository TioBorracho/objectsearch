/**
 * <p>
 * This annotations marks some class as a container
 * of another class that we want to index.
 * 
 * This annotation must be used when interceptor
 * doesn't have access to the object that we
 * want to index but it has access to a container object (DTO).
 * 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This annotation states that the contained object
 * is the one that must be indexed. The enclosing
 * object won't be indexed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The effect is the same that you'd get annotating
 * the contained object as @Indexbale
 * 
 * It's required that the contained object is annotated as @Indexbale
